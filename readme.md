An applet I created to play around with an open API and get to grips with the practicality of accessing one. I used the OpenWeather API to create this app that tells you the weather in your city. You will need to get a (free) API key to get this to work. Go to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and add a .env file in the root with this inside it:

WEATHER_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

## How to start

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
 npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
